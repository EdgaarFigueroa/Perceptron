# Perceptron
The implementation of a perceptron is carried out considering the step function and the sigmoid function as activation functions to obtain the perceptron output.
The implementation consists of 2 exercises:
  Exercise 1:
    Has as inputs X=[0.4,0.3,0.2], weights
    W=[0.9,0.4,0.3] and b=0
    a) Implementing the perceptron with the step function
    b) Implementing the perceptron with the sigmoid function
   Exercise 2:
    Has as inputs X=[0.4,0.3,0.2], weights
    W=[0.9,0.4,0.3], b=0 and expected output y=0.2
    a) Implementing the perceptron with the sigmoid function and calculate          the predicted output
    b)Calculate the residual error
    c)Calculate the SSE
